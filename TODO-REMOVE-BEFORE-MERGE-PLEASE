* I get lots of console messages and a
LOG4J:WARN no appenders could be found for logger org.jboss.logging
LOG4J:WARN Please initialize log4j system properly

is that because I removed the log4j-1.2-api bridge from legacy v1 to v2?
or is it that in other tests the log4j2-test.xml is not found?

* the Listener that starts openmrs in webapp depends on the log4j v1 api, how
did I miss this :horror: ?
