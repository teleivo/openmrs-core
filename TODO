* what if I want to validate a different object than the default target?
currently its doable with

validator.validate(obj, errors)

validate(obj) would be nice, but then Id have to reassign errors and possible
target.

ASSERTIONS

* some validators use reject, some rejectValue
 * we need assertions for both
 * we need assertions which properly check if an error code is contained in all
 fieldErrors or globalErrors
